# Observability with Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes

## Introduction
Welcome to the project repository! This project aims to implement observability in Kubernetes using Prometheus and Grafana. Through this setup, you will learn how to monitor applications and create dashboards that visualize various metrics.

## Project Overview
In this project, we will deploy an application and monitor it using various tools, including:
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Argo CD
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to set up observability in Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes
- Familiarity with Docker
- AWS account (if deploying on AWS)

## Installation Steps

1. **Setting Up the Instance**
   - Create a new instance named "Observability" with the following specifications:
     - Instance Type: `t2.micro`
     - Storage: `15GB`
     - Allow HTTP/HTTPS ports

2. **Install Required Tools**
   - Update the system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - Install Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install docker.io
     ```
   - Install `kubectl` for Kubernetes management:
     ```bash
     sudo snap install kubectl --classic
     ```

3. **Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Use Kind to create a Kubernetes cluster:
     ```bash
     kind create cluster --name my-cluster
     ```

4. **Install Helm**
   - Install Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes:
     ```bash
     curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
     ```

5. **Deploy Prometheus and Grafana**
   - Add the Prometheus community Helm repository:
     ```bash
     helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
     helm repo update
     ```
   - Install Prometheus:
     ```bash
     helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
     ```

6. **Accessing the Dashboards**
   - Forward the ports for Grafana and Prometheus:
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-server 9090:80
     kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:80
     ```
   - Access Grafana at `http://<your-instance-ip>:3000` and log in with the credentials.

## Creating Dashboards
- Create dashboards in Grafana by adding data sources and visualizing metrics from Prometheus. You can import existing dashboards or create new ones based on your requirements.

## Conclusion
This project will provide you with hands-on experience in setting up observability with Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes. Feel free to explore and modify the dashboards as needed.
